I have created this folder on advice of my friend Prajwal
to create a common used function library for my own usage.
So that I can use it's Functions on the go and don't have to think
much about minute logic but focusing more onto Problem Solving.

This files won't be only about a specific language but it will be
more of a problem solving solution in form of pseudo code. :>

To infinity and beyond:)
