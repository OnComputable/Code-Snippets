-- Read the following to get the required context -- 

1. Following programs are a set of tutorials published by the site - https://www.learncpp.com/ 
2. Thanks to these guys I am able to strengthen my understanding on C++.
3. Cpp Command: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wsign-conversion -Werror -pedantic-errors 2.cpp 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting a language standard in g++ [Choose your standard accordinagly]

For GCC/G++, you can pass compiler flags -std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, or -std=c++20 to enable C++11/14/17/20 support respectively. If you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use -std=c++2a for C++20 support instead.   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> For compiling program.
4. Cpp Command: -pedantic-errors  --> add this flag while compiling to comply the program to cpp standards
5. Cpp Name Synonym and versions:
Here’s a mapping of code names to the final names:

    c++1x = C++11
    c++1y = C++14
    c++1z = C++17
    c++2a = C++20
    c++2b = C++23

For example, if you see c++1z, this is synonymous with the C++17 language standard.
