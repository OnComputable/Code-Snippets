#For the first program of APUE to run 


->First use 'make' to compile all the files.


->
command:::

gcc -o obejct_file_name prog_name.c -I apue.3e/include/ -L apue.3e/lib/ -lapue

->Understanding what we did::
-I tells gcc which directory to look for the include file. -L tells it the location of the library directory, and -lapue, tells the name of the library file to look for in that directory
